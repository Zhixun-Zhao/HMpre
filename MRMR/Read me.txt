mRMR is a feature selection method developed by Hanchuan Peng. More about mRMR are availabel at website http://home.penglab.com/proj/mRMR/.

Our vision of mRMR is developed based on the work of Peng, and we want to express our thanks to the original developer. Since the train dataset is too large, researchers who are interested can build the dataset with the method in fold 'Feature Construction'.
